### RxJS - Connect4
A game built to try to learn more about functional programming.  In an attempt to become good at my craft i have decided to try RxJS + Connect4 to achieve this!  This is what i built, its a Christmas present to myself. - Michael

### Check it.
So `RxConnect4.js` contains all the flow for the game.  `GameLogic.js` contains winning logic.  I am sure i could put more things in there, but i just don't really care ;).  `ux.js` contains all the sweet ux crud.  `Node` class contains a `data` element which really is the state of the node.  It contains `hasPiece` and `viewNode`.  I know this is not the best design, but its simple, fact.
